# MemoryViz Webstepper Website

This folder contains the source code for the `memory-viz-webstepper` project.

## Developers

To run the demo website locally, follow these instructions from the `memory-viz/webstepper/` folder.

_Note_: you can instead run the commands in the root project directory by adding the argument `--workspace=webstepper`.

1. First, build the assets using Webpack:

    ```bash
    $ npm run build-dev
    ```

2. Then run the website:

    ```bash
    $ npm start
    ```

3. Visit the website at `http://localhost:9000`.
